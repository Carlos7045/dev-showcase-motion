# Portfolio Restoration - Requirements

## Introduction

The portfolio codebase has been corrupted by a problematic merge and refactoring that introduced unnecessary complexity and broken imports. We need to restore it to a clean, working state with only the essential components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Application Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, simple application structure that works without complex dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load without import errors
2. WHEN components are imported THEN they SHALL only reference existing files
3. WHEN the build runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without warnings about missing files

### Requirement 2: Functional Portfolio Website

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a working portfolio website with all essential sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the homepage THEN I SHALL see the hero section with typing animation
2. WHEN I scroll down THEN I SHALL see about, services, portfolio, and contact sections
3. WHEN I interact with elements THEN they SHALL respond appropriately (buttons, links, animations)

### Requirement 3: Clean Component Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to have their dependencies properly resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL not reference deleted utilities or hooks
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use working placeholder URLs or existing assets
3. WHEN animations run THEN they SHALL use only CSS or simple React state

### Requirement 4: Simplified Build Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean Vite configuration that doesn't reference non-existent files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL not show errors about missing chunks
2. WHEN building for production THEN it SHALL not reference deleted utility files
3. WHEN running in browser THEN it SHALL not show "process is not defined" errors

### Requirement 5: Essential Components Only

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want only the essential components needed for the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing components THEN there SHALL only be: HeroSection, AboutSection, ServicesSection, PortfolioSection, ContactSection, Footer, ScrollTechLogos
2. WHEN checking pages THEN there SHALL only be: Index.tsx and NotFound.tsx
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no unused imports or dead code
