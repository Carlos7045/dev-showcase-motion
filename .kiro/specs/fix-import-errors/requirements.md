# Fix Import Errors - Requirements

## Introduction

After cleaning up unnecessary files from the merge, several import errors have appeared in the codebase. These need to be resolved to get the application running properly again.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN there SHALL be no import errors for missing files
2. WHEN imports reference deleted files THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with alternatives
3. WHEN components depend on deleted utilities THEN they SHALL be refactored to work without them

### Requirement 2: Clean Up App.tsx Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want App.tsx to only import components and utilities that exist in the cleaned codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App.tsx is loaded THEN it SHALL only import existing components
2. WHEN routing is configured THEN it SHALL only reference existing pages
3. WHEN providers are used THEN they SHALL only reference existing context providers

### Requirement 3: Update Component Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all remaining components to have their dependencies properly resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components import utilities THEN those utilities SHALL exist in the codebase
2. WHEN components use hooks THEN those hooks SHALL be available or replaced with alternatives
3. WHEN components reference types THEN those types SHALL be defined or removed

### Requirement 4: Ensure Basic Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the portfolio website to load and display correctly after the cleanup.
